[Use the React project template with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/react?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It has been modified to work with Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider.

To use with Rider, you may need to edit ".NET Launch Settings Profile" for non-IIS Express and add "HOST=localhost" to "Environment variables".
